# Flux

Flux is a **utility-first** framework designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building UI elements in Roblox. Inspired by utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, this framework provides a set of predefined utility classes to style your Roblox GUIs efficiently.

⚠️ **Note:** This framework is in its prototype phase, with limited features. Stay tuned for more updates!

## Features

- **Utility-First Approach**: Apply pre-defined utilities directly to your UI elements for quick design iterations.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal features for fast prototyping.
- **Roblox-Centric**: Designed specifically for Roblox UI design, ensuring it works seamlessly with Roblox's GUI system.
