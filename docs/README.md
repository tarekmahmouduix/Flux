Easily Create Controllers
local Framework = require(Packages.framework)

local function Explode()
    print("KABOOM!!!")
end

return Framework.New({
    Explode = Explode,
})
Efficient and not verbose controller API, is very similar to vanilla modules and does not add any bloat.

Organized Dependencies
local Framework = require(Packages.framework)
local Dependency = require(Modules.Dependency)

-- Init is called after other dependencies the module uses are loaded
local function Init()
    Dependency.NuclearExplosion() -- This dependency loads first and in result is usable!
end

return Framework.New({
    Uses = {Dependency},
    Init = Init,
})
Organizes your dependencies in an understandable way, so you can easily keep track of what your module uses.

Simple Worker Design
local Framework = require(Packages.framework)

local function Init()
    Framework.Worker("PostSimulation", function()
        print("I print every frame!")
    end)
end

return Framework.New({
    Init = Init,
})
Has a simple worker/lifecycle design that is readable and accessible at a glance.

Finally...
Try it out and see if you love it! It comes in a very small size and is easily embeddable into already existing game architecture; no extra dependencies are required. With built-in plugin support, a thriving community, and type safety, what's truly not to like about it?
